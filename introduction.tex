Rule-based modeling languages for molecular biology, such as Kappa
\cite{DanosEtAl-CONCUR07} and BioNetGen \cite{bngl}, or organic
chemistry, such as M{\o}d \cite{moll}, can be used to write
mechanistic models of complex reaction systems. In these approaches,
chemical transformations are represented by local graph-rewrite rules
equipped with stochastic firing rates. In a dynamical simulation,
rules induce a time series of events that might reach a state of
interest in processes like the assembly of a molecular machine, the
activation of a transcription factor, or the synthesis of a specific
chemical compound. While rule-based models provide compactness,
transparency, and the ability of handling combinatorial complexity,
the perhaps most significant advantage lies in their suitability for
causal analysis.

The causal analysis
\cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/DanosFFHH12,DanosEtAl-CONCUR07} of event series
generated by such models provides a formal definition of ``pathway"
and a means for revealing the emergence of pathways from low-level
interactions. These methods take advantage of rule structure to
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item compress a given simulation trace into a minimal subset of
  events that are necessary and jointly sufficient to replicate a
  phenomenon of interest and
\item highlight the direct causal influences between events, exposing
  the extent of concurrency.
\end{inparaenum}

% There is much more to discuss here.

We propose a distinct but complementary approach based on
\textit{counterfactual reasoning} that improves causal explanations by
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item being more sensitive to kinetics and
\item properly accounting for the causal impact from inhibition
  between events.
\end{inparaenum}
