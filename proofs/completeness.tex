It is convenient to prove the following result instead, which is
slightly more general.
\begin{theorem*} Let $(\tau, \iota, \tau')$ be a counterfactual
  experiment. If $e$ is an event that belongs only to $\tau$
  \textbf{or $\tau'$}, then there exists an event $\hat e$ in
  $\tau$ that is blocked by $\iota$ and there is a directed path 
  from $\hat e$ to $e$.
\end{theorem*}
\begin{proof}
  We prove this theorem by induction on the number of events before
  $e$ in both $\tau$ and $\tau'$. Let's consider $e \in \tau$ such
  that $e \notin \tau'$. If $\BLOCKED{\iota}{e}$ is true, then we are
  done. Otherwise, by item ($\ref{valid-cex:co-occur}$) of
  Proposition~\ref{prop:valid-cex}, $e$ is not executable in
  $\tau'$. Therefore, there exists a site $s$ such that event $e$
  tests $s$ to a different value than it has in $\TSTATE{t}{\tau'}$.
  Let $t$ the time of occurence of $e$.  Besides, let's define $e_0$
  the last event in $\tau$ modifying $s$ that occurs strictly before
  time $t$, and $e_0'$ the last event in $\tau'$ modifying $s$ that
  occurs strictly before time $t$. These events modify $s$ to
  different values so they cannot be the same. Therefore, writing
  $t_0$ and $t_0'$ their respective time of occurence, we have
  $t_0 \neq t_0'$ with probability one.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item If $t_0 < t_0'$, then we have $e_0 \notin \tau'$
    and so we can apply the induction hypothesis on $e_0$. As a
    consequence, there exists a path from an event $\hat e$ in $\tau$
    which is blocked by $\iota$ to $e_0$. Besides, $e_0$ enables
    $e$. Therefore, there is a path from $\hat e$ to $e$.
  \item If $t_0' < t_0$, then we have $e'_0 \notin \tau$
    and so we can apply the induction hypothesis on $e'_0$. As a
    consequence, there exists a path from an event $\hat e$ in $\tau$
    which is blocked by $\iota$ to $e'_0$. Besides, $e_0'$ prevents
    $e$. Therefore, there is a path from $\hat e$ to $e$.
  \end{itemize}
  The same proof holds for when $e \in \tau'$ and $e \notin \tau$,
  using item~($\ref{valid-cex:co-occur2}$) of
  Proposition~\ref{prop:valid-cex} instead of
  item~($\ref{valid-cex:co-occur}$).
\end{proof}
This result implies Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness}. Indeed, we only
need to prove that the constructed path from $\hat e$ to $e$ contains
an even number of prevention arrows, which is true for \textit{any}
such path as prevention arrows always go from $\tau$ to $\tau'$ or the
other way around but cannot ``stay'' within a single trace.
