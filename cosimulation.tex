\section{Evaluating Counterfactual
  Statements}\label{sec:counterfactual}

In our example, the counterfactual statement to be
assessed is: ``Had $pk$ not happened, $p$ would not have happened."
Our account in the previous section suggests that $pk$ played a role,
but it is also clear that given the stochastic nature of rule firing
$p$ could well have happened even in the absence of $pk$; it just is
unlikely. In a stochastic setting, counterfactual statements are not
either true or false, but have degrees of likelihood. To assess that
likelihood is our task.

Given an original (factual) trace $\tau$, a naive approach might be to sample
counterfactual traces, each of which starts with the state of the system
attained in $\tau$ just before event $pk$ happened, but in which we skip over
$pk$ and then run an unconstrained simulation from that point onward. In this
approach traces would quickly diverge from the original, distorting the causal
role that $pk$ played specifically in it. The question here is not what causal
role $pk$ can play in principle, but what role it actually did play in $\tau$.
Counterfactual statements are undetachable from the context in which they are
formulated.

Pearl's standard account of counterfactuals \cite{pearl2009causality}
is based on performing \textit{``surgical interventions''} on a
structural equation model (SEM). A SEM features a finite sequence
$(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ of variables, each associated to a
\emph{functional equation} of the form
$x_i = f_i(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1}, u_i)$, where $f_i$ is a deterministic
function and $u_i$ a random variable. Ideally, each $f_i$ defines an
independent and autonomous physical mechanism. This is partially
enforced by the requirement that the $u_i$ must be mutually
independent. Given some observation $e$, the probability of the
counterfactual statement ``had $x_j$ been equal to $a$, $\psi$ would
have been true'' is evaluated following a three-steps process:
\begin{inparaenum}[]
\item \ItAbduction{} compute the distribution $p_e$ of values for
  $\vec u$ given observation $e$, then
\item \ItAction{} intervene in the model by replacing the defining
  equation for $x_j$ by ``$x_j = a$'' and finally
\item \ItPrediction{} compute the probability that $\psi$ is true in
  this new model when $\vec{u}$ is distributed according to $p_e$.
\end{inparaenum}

Because of their dynamic and combinatorial nature, rule-based models do
not have structural equations that are readily available at the
outset. However, Pearl's construction generalizes to our setting,
provided that we separate the randomness of simulation from its
deterministic causal mechanisms.

\subsection{A Semantics for Counterfactuals}
\label{subsec:counterfactuals-semantics}

An intervention $\iota$ is defined by a predicate
$\BLOCKED{\iota}{\cdot}$ ranging over events. The purpose of the
predicate is to act as a filter preventing the occurrence of selected
events. Given a predicate $\psi$ over traces, we write the statement
\textit{``Had intervention $\iota$ happened in trace $\tau$, $\psi$
  would have been true''} as $\CFST{}$, borrowing a notation from
\cite{halpern2016actual}.

To assign a probability to this statement, we must
reconceptualize the CTMC induced by a model so as to
separate the stochastic and deterministic aspects of a trace.
This can be done as follows:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item Consider all possible event templates $(r, \xi)$, where $\xi$
  maps into a large enough set of global identifiers. For each event
  template, imagine a Poisson process in which a bell rings at time
  intervals drawn independently from an exponential distribution with
  parameter $\lambda_r$. These Poisson processes are all gathered in a
  random variable $\Sigma$ that we call \emph{schedule}, and which
  features the sequence of ringing times of every bell.
\item
  To a realization $\sigma$ of $\Sigma$, we associate a unique
  trace $T(\sigma)$ that is generated as follows: starting with the
  initial mixture and moving through time, whenever a bell rings, its
  associated event template $e$ is realized by transforming the
  current mixture $m$ if $\TRIGGERABLE{m}{e}$. For
  example, if the current mixture $m$ is given as in
  Figure~\ref{fig:mixture} and the bell linked to \textit{``apply rule
    $b$ on substrate $3$ and kinase $4$''} rings, a bond is created
  between these two agents. In contrast, the bell linked to
  \textit{``apply rule $b$ on substrate $1$ and kinase $2$'}' would
  have no effect.
\end{inparaenum}

Intuitively, $\Sigma$ determines when the opportunity for a reaction
happens and between which molecules. It captures the randomness of
simulation and plays the same role as the random vector $\vec u$ in a
SEM. In contrast, $\sigma \mapsto T(\sigma)$ is a deterministic
function that controls what a reaction does when it occurs.  It
corresponds to the $f_i$ in a SEM and is likewise the target of
interventions.

%By construction, the random trace $T(\Sigma)$ is distributed
%  according to the CTMC semantics of Kappa discussed in
%  section~\ref{sec:background}.

For an intervention $\iota$ and a random realization $\sigma$, we
define the altered trace $\ATRAJ{}(\sigma)$ much in the same way as
$T(\sigma)$, but also requiring $\BLOCKED{\iota}{(e, t)}$ to be false
for $e$ to be realized when its bell rings at $t$.  Given an observed
trace $\tau$, an intervention $\iota$ and a predicate $\psi$, the
probability of $\CFST{}$ can now be defined according to Pearl's
three-steps strategy: \ItAbduction{} condition the distribution of
$\Sigma$ by the observation that $T(\Sigma)\!=\!\tau$, then
\ItAction{} alter the behavior of $T$  with intervention
$\iota$ and \ItPrediction{} consider the probability of $\psi$ in the
resulting setting. This results in the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Semantics of counterfactual statements]
\label{def:counterfactuals}
  For $\tau$ an observed trace, $\iota$ an intervention and $\psi$ a
  predicate on traces, the probability of the counterfactual statement
  \textit{``had intervention $\iota$ happened in trace $\tau$,
    predicate $\psi$ would have been true''} is defined as:
  \[ \PCFST{} \eqdef \ \ProbParen{\psi(\ATRAJ{}(\Sigma)) \ |\ T(\Sigma) = \tau}. \]
\end{definition}
In the rest of this paper, we use the shorthand notations $T$ and
$T_\iota$ for the random traces $T(\Sigma)$ and $T_\iota(\Sigma)$
respectively.

\subsection{The Counterfactual Resimulation Algorithm}
\label{subsec:cosim-algo}

Following Definition~\ref{def:counterfactuals}, we estimate the
probability of the counterfactual statement $\CFST{}$ by sampling
instances of the random variable $\CTRAJ{}$ 
(i.e. $T_\iota(\Sigma) \,|\, \{ T(\Sigma) = \tau \}$). 
Such instances are called
\emph{counterfactual traces}. Intuitively, they give an account of
what else trace $\tau$ could have been, had intervention $\iota$
happened.  We introduce Algorithm~\ref{alg:cosimulation}, a variation
of the Doob-Gillespie algorithm, to sample a counterfactual trace
efficiently given a reference trace $\tau$ and an intervention
$\iota$. We call it \emph{counterfactual resimulation}, since it works
by going through every event of $\tau$, resimulating only those parts
of $\tau$ that are affected by $\iota$. In particular, when $\iota$ is
the trivial intervention ($\BLOCKED{\iota}{\cdot} = \text{false}$), it
returns $\tau$.

This algorithm relies on a modified notion of activity we call
\emph{divergent activity}. We define the set of \emph{divergent
  embeddings} of the left-hand side of a rule $r$ into mixture $m$ and
relative to $m_0$ as
% \tryinline{\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0} \eqdef \EMBS{r}{m} \setminus
% \EMBS{r}{m_0}.}
$\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0} \eqdef \EMBS{r}{m} \setminus \EMBS{r}{m_0}.$
Equivalently, a divergent embedding is an embedding whose codomain
features a \emph{divergent site}, that is, a site whose state differs
across $m$ and $m_0$. The {divergent activity} of a rule $r$ in
mixture $m$ relative to $m_0$ is then the product
$\lambda_r|\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0}|$. The \emph{total divergent activity} of
the system, $\alpha'(m, m_0)$, is the sum of all divergent
activities. Finally, we use the notation $\TSTATE{t}{\tau}$ to refer
to the mixture at time $t$ in $\tau$\longversion{, which is obtained
  from the initial mixture after updating it for each event in turn up
  to time $t$ in $\tau$}.

\input{algos/cosimulation}

The role and relevance of the concept of divergent activity in
counterfactual resimulation is summarized by the following
proposition, where $\tau \cap I = \emptyset$ is a shortcut for ``no
event of trace $\tau$ occurs in the time interval $I$''.
\begin{proposition}[Property of the divergent
  activity]\label{prop:div-activity}
  For $\tau$ a trace and $\iota$ an intervention, let
  $I = (t, t+\delta)$ be a time interval such that
  $\tau \cap I = \emptyset$ and $m_0 = \TSTATE{t}{\tau}$. Then, we
  have
  \[\CProb{ \ATRAJ{} \cap I = \emptyset }{ T=\tau,\
      \TSTATE{t}{\ATRAJ{}} = m\ }
    \ =\ e^{-\alpha'(m, m_0) \cdot \delta}.
  \]
\end{proposition}
\noindent At every iteration of Algorithm~\ref{alg:cosimulation}, the
divergent activity $\alpha'$ determines the probability that an event
happens in the counterfactual trace prior to the next event in the
factual trace $\tau$ (test of line \ref{cosim:cev}).  A proof of
Proposition~\ref{prop:div-activity} is given in
Appendix~A. %\ref{ap:div-activity}.
It is the main step in establishing:

\begin{theorem}%[Correctness of counterfactual resimulation]
  The counterfactual resimulation algorithm correctly
  samples instances of $\,\CTRAJ{}$.
  %as defined in
  %section~\ref{subsec:counterfactuals-semantics}.
\end{theorem}

\input{implementation.tex}

Returning to our running example, sampling counterfactual traces repeatedly for
\RefTrace{} would reveal that, with very high probability, ``event $p$ would not
have happened, had $pk$ not happened''. However, we can go further by using
counterfactual traces to \textit{explain} this observation using enablement and
prevention arrows.
