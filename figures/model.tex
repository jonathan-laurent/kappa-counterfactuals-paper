  % \caption{A motivating toy model. As usual in Kappa, sites not
  %   mentioned in a rule are left unchanged by it. Instead of naming
  %   sites, we here identify them by their position on an

  %   not specified here but dotted arrows indicate \textit{slow}
  %   reactions, whereas solid arrows indicate \textit{fast} reactions.}
