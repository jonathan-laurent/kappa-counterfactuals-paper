  \caption{A mixture graph. Sites should be named, but are here simply
    identified through their position on agents\longversion{
      (phosphorylation sites are always shown on top). The relative
      position of agents in the figure is insignificant}.  Sites in a
    phosphorylated state are shown in gray. Number labels are global
    agent identifiers.}
