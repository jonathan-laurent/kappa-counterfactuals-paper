  \caption{An example of a reaction mixture. Instead of naming sites,
    we here identify them by their position on
    agents\longversion{(phosphorylation sites are always shown on
      top). The relative position of agents in the figure is
    insignificant}.  Phosphorylated sites are shown in gray.  Number
    labels correspond to global agent identifiers. }
