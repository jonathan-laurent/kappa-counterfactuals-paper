  Rule-based modeling languages can be used to write mechanistic
  models of complex biochemical systems. Some techniques have been
  proposed to analyze the causal structure of such models, ideally
  providing a way to uncover signalling pathways from networks of low
  level protein-protein interactions. These methods basically take
  advantage of the structure of the rules to i) slice simulation
  traces into minimal subsets of events that are sufficient to
  replicate a phenomenon of interest ii) highlight direct causal
  influences between non-concurrent events.

  We propose a different but complementary approach that is based on
  counterfactual reasoning and claim that it can provide better causal
  explanations by i) being more sensitive to kinetics and ii)
  providing a proper account of inhibition between molecular events.
