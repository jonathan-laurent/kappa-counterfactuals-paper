  Rule-based modeling languages can be used to write mechanistic
  models of complex biochemical systems. Some techniques have been
  proposed to analyze the causal structure of such models, ideally
  providing a way to uncover signalling pathways from networks of low
  level protein-protein interactions. These methods basically take
  advantage of the structure of the rules to
  \begin{inparaenum}[i)]
  \item slice simulation traces into minimal subsets of events that
    are sufficient to replicate a phenomenon of interest
  \item highlight direct causal influences between non-concurrent
    events.
  \end{inparaenum}

  We propose a different but complementary approach that is based on
  counterfactual reasoning and claim that it can provide better causal
  explanations by 
  \begin{inparaenum}[i)]
  \item being more sensitive to kinetics
  \item providing a proper account of inhibition between molecular events.
  \end{inparaenum}
