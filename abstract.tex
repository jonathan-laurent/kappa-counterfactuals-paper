\begin{abstract}
  Rule-based modeling languages can be used to write mechanistic
  models of complex reaction systems. Some techniques have been
  proposed to analyze the causal structure of the event series that
  are produced by simulating such models, ideally providing means for
  revealing the emergence of pathways from low-level interactions.
  Unfortunately, these techniques are mostly blind to stochastic rates
  and fail at giving a proper account of inhibition between events. In
  response to those issues, we propose a complementary approach that
  is based on counterfactual reasoning. In particular, we introduce an
  algorithm to uncover the causal structure of simulation traces by
  exploring counterfactual scenarios that account for various external
  interventions. Then, we show how such scenarios can be analyzed in
  term of inhibition between factual and counterfactual events.
