Suppose you are simulating a counterfactual trace for intervention
$\iota$ and reference trace $\tau$, that is, you are drawing an
instance of $\CTRAJ{}$. Suppose you have already simulated the first
$t$ seconds of this counterfactual trace and you want to know the time
of the next event. Because both $T$, $\ATRAJ{}$ and $\Sigma$ are
markovian, the only only relevant information about what has already
been simulated is the current state of the counterfactual world
$s := \TSTATE{t}{\ATRAJ{}}$.

At some point, we have to define
\[\EMBS{r}{m} = \{ \xi \,:\, m \vdash (r, \xi) \}\]
and notice that
\[\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0} = \EMBS{r}{m} \setminus \EMBS{r}{m_0}.\]


\begin{definition}[Divergent embedding]
  Let $m$ a mixture and $m_0$ a reference mixture. A site $s$ is said
  to be \emph{divergent} if it is in a different state in $m$ and in
  $m_0$.  Then, an embedding $\xi$ of a rule $r$ into $m$ is said to
  be \emph{divergent} if it features a divergent site. We write
  $\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0}$ the set of such embeddings.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Divergent activity]
  The \emph{divergent activity} of a rule $r$ is defined as the
  product of its reaction rate $\lambda_r$ by the cardinal of
  $\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0}$.  The total divergent activity of the system
  $\alpha'(m, m_0)$ is defined as the sum of the divergent activity of
  every rule:
  \[\alpha'(m, m_0) = \sum_r \lambda_r |\DEMBS{r}{m, m_0}| \]
\end{definition}
