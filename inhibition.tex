\section{Counterfactuals and inhibition}\label{sec:inhibition}

Returning to our example, we can use co-simulation to quantify the
influence of $pk$ on $p$ by estimating the probability of $p$
happening had $pk$ not occurred. However, we can go further by using
counterfactual traces to \textit{explain} this influence using both
activation and inhibition arrows (Figure~\ref{fig:cex}).

Activation arrows are easy to define and identify in a trace. We say
that an event $e$ activates $e'$ if $e$ is the last event before $e'$
that modifies some site to the value it is tested for by
$e'$. Inhibition arrows are trickier because they must relate events
that happened to events that did not. We use counterfactual traces to
give a rigorous account of inhibition using arrows that connect events
from the factual trace to events in the counterfactual trace and vice
versa.

A \textit{counterfactual experiment} is any triple
$(\tau, \iota, \tau')$ for which there exists a random realization
$\omega$ such that $\tau = T(\omega)$ and $\tau' =
\ATRAJ{}(\omega)$. Such triples are produced by co-simulation.

\begin{proposition}%[Characterization of counterfactual experiments]
  \label{prop:valid-cex}
  A triple $(\tau, \iota, \tau')$ is a counterfactual experiment if
  and only if all of the following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.3cm, label=\textbf{VC\arabic*.}]
  \item \label{valid-cex:valid-traces} Both $\tau$ and $\tau'$ are
    valid traces
  \item \label{valid-cex:no-blocking} No event of $\tau'$ is blocked
    by $\iota$
  \item \label{valid-cex:co-occur} For every event $(e, t) \in \tau$
    such that $(e, t) \notin \tau'$, then either $e$ is not
    triggerable in $\TSTATE{t}{\tau'}$ or $(e, t)$ is blocked by
    $\iota$.  Besides, for every event $(e', t') \in \tau'$ such that
    $(e', t') \notin \tau$, then $e'$ is not triggerable in
    $\TSTATE{t}{\tau}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


\begin{definition}
  Let $(\tau, \iota, \tau')$ a counterfactual experiment. An
  event $e$ that occurs at time $t$ in $\tau$ is said to inhibit an
  event $e'$ that occurs at time $t'$ in $\tau'$ if all of the
  following hold:
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.2cm, label=\textbf{IC\arabic*.}]
  \item \label{inhibition:time} $t < t'$
  \item \label{inhibition:breaks} there exists a site $s$ such that
    $e$ is the last event in $\tau$ before $t'$ that modifies the
    value of $s$ away from what $e'$ tests it for
  \item \label{inhibition:nointf} there are no events in $\tau'$ that
    modify $s$ during the time interval $(t, t')$.
  \end{enumerate}
  The same definiton holds switching $\tau$ and $\tau'$.
\end{definition}

Figure~\ref{fig:cex} shows the influence of $pk$ on $p$ based on a
counterfactual experiment. Dotted nodes correspond to events proper to
the counterfactual trace $\tau'$, thick nodes to events proper to the
factual trace $\tau$, and the remaining nodes correspond to events
common to both traces. Activation arrows are depicted in black and
inhibition arrows in red.

The example illustrates the influence of $pk$ on $p$ mediated by the
counterfactual event $u$. Such mediating events always exist, as
stated by the following theorem.  %In general, we can always %exhibit
a sequence of intermediate events connected by activation and
inhibitio%n %arrows to relate an event that is proper to the factual
trace to another %one that is blocked by the intervention $\iota$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:completeness} Let $(\tau, \iota, \tau')$ be a counterfactual
  experiment and $e$ an event that belongs only to $\tau$. Then there
  exists an event $e_0 \in \tau$ that is blocked by $\iota$ and there
  is a path from $e_0$ to $e$ with an even number of inhibition
  arrows.
\end{theorem}
