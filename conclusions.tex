\section*{Conclusions}

We have proposed a new way to generate causal explanations in Kappa
based on counterfactual reasoning, in which causal explanation are
augmented by including inhibition between events. By leveraging the
Kappa stochastic simulator for co-simulation, we expect this technique
to increase the sensitivity of explanatory accounts to kinetics.

Future work will investigate how this approach interacts with trace
compression \cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/DanosFFHH12} and establish
heuristics to determine which counterfactual interventions are worth
attempting on a given reference trace.
