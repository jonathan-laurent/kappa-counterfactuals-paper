%% BACKGROUND ON KAPPA
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, we give some background information on the Kappa
modelling language and introduce a toy example that motivates the need
for counterfactual reasoning in analyzing the causal structure of
simulationt traces.


\subsection{Some background on Kappa}

In Kappa, proteins and other organic molecules are modelled by
abstract \emph{agents} with distinguishable \emph{sites}. Agents can
bind to each other through these sites and some sites also hold an
internal state. A site can only be engaged in at most one bond. The
number and the nature of the sites featured by an agent depend on its
\emph{type}, each type of agent being described in the model's
\emph{signature}. In our running example, there are two types of
agents: substrates $S$ and kinases $K$. Agents of both type feature a
binding site $b$ and a phosphorylation site $x$ with two possible
internal states: \emph{default} and \emph{phosphorylated}.

We call \emph{mixture} a multiset of agents for which the internal
state and binding state of every site is fully specified.  Individual
agents are given global identifiers so that we can refer to them
unambiguously. \input{figures/mixture}
\noindent
Chemical interactions between agents are modelled by local
mixture-rewriting \emph{rules} with stochastic firing rates.
Together, the rules of a model denote a continuous-time Markov chain.

Agents in our example model are subject to the set of rules depicted
in Figure~\ref{fig:model}. As expressed by these rules, kinases and
substrates can bind to each other provided that their respective
binding sites are free (rule ``$b$''). owever, the resulting complex is very
unstable unless the kinase involved is phosphorylated. This is
modelled by introducing two unbind rules (``$u$'' and ``$u^{*}$'') with
different rates. Also, a substrate can get phosphorylated when it is
bound to a kinase (rule ``$p$''). Finally, for the sake of simplicity, we
model the phosphorylation process of kinases as a spontaneous process
(rule ``$pk$'').

\input{figures/model}



\paragraph{Other concepts and notations}

An \emph{embedding} of the left hand side $L_r$ of a rule $r$ to a mixture $m$
is a map $\xi$ from agents of $L_r$ to global agent identifiers such that






%Stochastic simulations of Kappa models can be run using the Gillespie
%algorithm, which is summarized Listing~\ref{alg:gillespie}.

%\input{algos/gillespie}

% In Gillespie's algorithm, the activity of a rule $r$ is defined as the
% product $\lambda_r|\EMBS{r}{M}|$ of its reaction rate by the number of
% embeddings of its left hand side in the current reaction mixture.
% Then, simulating a trace works by repeating the following steps:
% \begin{inparaenum}[1)]
% \item draw the time before the next simulation event from an
%   exponential distribution of parameter the total activity $\alpha$ of
%   the rules and increment the current time by this amount
% \item draw a rule $r$ with probability proportional to its activity
% \item pick an instance of the left hand side of $r$ uniformly in the
%   current mixture and rewrite it.
% \end{inparaenum}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% TRADITIONAL PATHWAY ANALYSIS FALLS SHORT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Where traditional pathway analysis falls short}



For the sake of simplicity, consider an initial mixture $I$ with only
a single kinase and a single substrate whose sites are free and
unphosphorylated. We then ask: Starting from $I$, \textbf{how} is $p$
triggered ? We are not merely looking for an account of reachability
but rather for causal narratives, that is, collections of necessary
events connected by causal influences. 

A stochastic simulation \cite{DanosEtAl-APLAS07} might produce the
following trace (events are labelled by the rules that induced them):
\begin{align}\label{example-trace} b,\ \ u,\ \ pk,\ \ b,\ \ p,\ \
  u^{*},\ \ \cdots
\end{align} Figure~\ref{fig:dumb-story} depicts the causal narrative
explaining the occurrence of $p$ according to existing techniques
\cite{DBLP:conf/fsttcs/DanosFFHH12,DanosEtAl-CONCUR07}. The arrow
between $b$ and $p$ is called an \textit{activation arrow}, meaning
that $b$ modifies an aspect of state (by creating a link) that enables
$p$ to happen.

\input{figures/dumb-story}

This narrative, however, is blind to the critical role of $pk$ in the
original trace. Looking at the rules in Figure~\ref{fig:model} one
notes that:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item the phosphorylation rule $p$ is slow
\item the average time $K$ and $S$ remain bound depends on whether $K$
  is phosphorylated, as manifest in the two unbinding rules $u$ (fast,
  if $K$ is not phosphorylated) and $u^{*}$ (slow, if $K$ is
  phosphorylated).
\end{inparaenum} It seems reasonable to assert that $p$ would probably
not have happened had $pk$ not happened, as the opportunity for $p$
would have been cut short by a fast unbinding event. We therefore
argue that $pk$, although it does not activate $b$ or $p$ directly,
should be part of a causal narrative for $p$. Reasoning of this kind
is \textit{counterfactual} and can be deployed to define causality
\cite{lewis1974causation,lewis2000causation}.

In section~\ref{sec:counterfactual}, we give a rigorous semantics to
this line of reasoning. In section~\ref{sec:inhibition} we show that
counterfactual statements can be expressed using inhibition arrows,
leading to the explanation shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cex}.

% Therefore, although the causal relevance of $pk$ cannot be justified
by activation arrows, it is supported by a counterfactual statement.
% In the rest of this abstract, we %give a formal semantics to
counterfactual statements and investigate how %they can be used %to
produce more satisfying causal explanations.
