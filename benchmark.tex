We assessed the performances of our implementation of counterfactual
resimulation on our example model (Figure~\ref{fig:model}), using an
initial mixture that features $10^4$ substrates and the same number of
kinases.  Although such a simple setting is not of particular
biological significance, it is adequate for an initial performance
benchmark.

In this benchmark, whose results are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:bench}, we consider four different kinds of
interventions, which are all defined relative to a single event
$e_0=((r_0, \xi_0), t_0)$:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0.4cm]
\item \textit{Punctual knock-down:} block $e_0$ only. In other words,
  $\BLOCKED{\iota}{e} \eqdef (e = e_0)$.
\item \textit{Template knock-down:} block the event template
  associated to $e_0$, starting at time $t_0$. In other words,
  $\BLOCKED{\iota}{((r, \xi), t)} \eqdef ((r, \xi) = (r_0, \xi_0)
  \,\wedge\, t \geq t_0)$.
\item \textit{Rule knock-down for modified agents:} block any
  application of rule $r_0$ that tests an agent modified by $e_0$,
  starting at time $t_0$. In other words,
  $\BLOCKED{\iota}{((r, \xi), t)} \eqdef (r = r_0 \,\wedge\, \xi(L_r)
    \cap M_0 \neq \emptyset \,\wedge\, t \geq t_0)$ where $M_0$ is
  the set of agents modified by $e_0$.
\item \textit{Rule knock-down:} block the rule $r_0$, starting at time
  $t_0$. In other words,
  $\BLOCKED{\iota}{((r, \xi), t)} \eqdef (r = r_0 \,\wedge\, t \geq
  t_0)$.
\end{enumerate}
The \emph{slowdown} $S$ is defined as
\[ S \eqdef \frac{|\tau|}{|\tau \cup \tau'|} \cdot \frac{T'}{T} \]
