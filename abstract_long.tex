\begin{abstract}
  With the advance of experimental technologies in molecular biology,
  there is not only a need to aggregate but also interpret information
  about complex molecular systems of interaction. Rule-based models
  capable of translating mechanistic information into systems dynamics
  will play a central role in identifying targets for and
  understanding mechanisms of interventions in cellular
  processes. While this approach often replaces a world we don't
  understand with a model we don't understand, the latter can be
  subject to causal analysis difficult to achieve in the
  former. Existing techniques for such models are based on viewing
  causality as a relation of enablement between events. Here, we
  complement this approach by including relations of prevention,
  consistent with the ubiquitous occurrence of inhibitory interactions
  in biology. To this end, we propose and implement a method for
  executing computational experiments that provide a rigorous
  semantics to counterfactual statements. Our method is close in
  spirit to the ideas developed by Pearl and Halpern, but addresses
  models whose mechanistic complexity is not readily translatable into
  structural equations. By leveraging a stochastic simulator, we sample
  counterfactual trajectories that are probabilistically as close to a
  given factual trajectory as a chosen intervention permits them to
  be.
